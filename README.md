# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-of-Python-Trend-Among-Developers-using-Python
This study would help to analyze and extract insights related to developer salaries and trends in Python usage especially in countries like United States, India, United Kingdom, Canada and Germany. 
This includes tasks such as cleaning the dataset, identifying outliers in salary data, visualizing Python awareness among developers, comparing salaries between Python and non-Python users, and examining the relationship between Python knowledge and salary. 
It also involves exploring correlations between different features and identifying factors that influence developer salaries.
