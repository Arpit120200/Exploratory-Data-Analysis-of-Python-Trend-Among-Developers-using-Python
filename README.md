# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Python Trend Among Developers using Python

This project explores trends in Python usage among developers and how it correlates with their salaries across different countries, including the United States, India, United Kingdom, Canada, and Germany.

Using a structured approach to data cleaning, visualization, and statistical correlation analysis, the project provides deep insights into how Python knowledge influences compensation, awareness, and developer demographics globally.

## ✅ Key Objectives

- 📌 Analyze Python awareness and usage among global developers
- 📌 Compare salaries between Python and non-Python users
- 📌 Investigate correlation between Python knowledge and higher income
- 📌 Identify country-wise trends in developer demographics
- 📌 Detect outliers in salary and clean noisy data

## 📈 Tools & Technologies

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly  
- **Techniques:** Data Cleaning, Correlation Analysis, GroupBy Aggregation, Outlier Detection  
- **Platform:** Jupyter Notebook  
- **Presentation:** PowerPoint (Methodology & Findings)

## 📊 Key Insights

- Developers proficient in Python tend to earn higher average salaries in most countries studied.
- The United States has the highest median salary for Python developers, followed by Germany and Canada.
- Python awareness is growing steadily across all developer age groups.
- Significant correlation was found between Python usage and job roles in data science, machine learning, and back-end development.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arpit120200/Exploratory-Data-Analysis-of-Python-Trend-Among-Developers-using-Python.git
cd Exploratory-Data-Analysis-of-Python-Trend-Among-Developers-using-Python
````

### 2. Install Required Libraries

Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed.

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly
```

### 3. Run the Notebook

```bash

```

## 📌 Future Scope

* Incorporate more recent datasets for temporal comparison
* Add interactive dashboards using **Plotly Dash** or **Streamlit**
* Apply ML techniques to predict salary based on skillset and geography

## 📁 Notes

* `dataset.zip` must be extracted to access the raw CSV/Excel files
* The `.pptx` presentation is useful for showcasing findings in academic or professional settings
